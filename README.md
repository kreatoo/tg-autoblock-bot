# tg-autoblock-bot
Simple Telegram selfbot that autoblocks everyone that is not in your Contacts.

# Setup
Requirements:
* Python
* Telethon (install by running `pip install telethon`)
* Telegram API key (get it from my.telegram.org)

Edit `api_id`, `api_hash` and `message`. `session_name` can stay the same.

Run the bot;

```sh
# python main.py
```

It will ask for your credentials.

And that is it! You can also build the docker container and use that instead.
